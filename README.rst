django-restumize
================

A truly custom REST API Framework. Provides automatic parameters validation
(similar to Django's Form), custom GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH handler as
well as automatic data serialization (similar with tornado, but support json, 
jsonp, xml, yaml, html and plist). Many code come straight from Django and 
django-tastypie.
