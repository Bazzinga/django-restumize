================

A truly custom REST API Framework for Django. Provides automatic parameters 
validation (similar to Django's Form), custom GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH 
handler as well as automatic data serialization (similar with tornado, but 
support json, jsonp, xml, yaml and plist). Many code come straight from Django 
and django-tastypie projects.
